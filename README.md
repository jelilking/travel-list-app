## Overview

### The Challenge

The Travelist App is designed to help users manage their travel packing lists efficiently. Users can add items to their packing list, mark items as packed, delete items, sort the list by different criteria, and clear the entire list with a confirmation prompt. The app also provides real-time statistics on the user's packing progress.

## My Process

### Built With

- React
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS

### What I Learned

While building the Travelist App, I reinforced my understanding of React hooks such as `useState`. I also gained more experience with handling user interactions, managing state, and updating the UI dynamically. The project helped me improve my skills in conditional rendering, list management, and form handling in React.

### Continued Development

In future development, I plan to:

- Add user authentication to allow users to save and retrieve their packing lists.
- Implement local storage to persist the packing list between sessions.
- Enhance the UI with more interactive elements and animations.
- Improve the accessibility and responsiveness of the app.
